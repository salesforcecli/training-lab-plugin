# Training Lab: Salesforce CLI Plugin

This Training Lab demonstrates how to build a simple Salesforce CLI plugin.

The sample code provided will help you build a working example of a Salesforce CLI plugin that does three things.

1. Creates a "hello world" CLI command: `sf hello world`.
2. Creates a CLI hook that runs before any `sf` command is executed.
3. Creates a CLI hook that listens for a "pre deploy" event and takes action based on the contents of the deployment.

TODO: Update the rest of this doc.

## Prepare Your CodeBuilder Training Environment

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salesforcecli/training-lab-plugin/main/setup-training-lab | bash
```

## Install

```bash
sf plugins install deployment-validator@x.y.z
```

### Build

To build the plugin locally, make sure to have yarn installed and run the following commands:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:salesforcecli/deployment-validator

# Install the dependencies and compile
yarn && yarn build
```

To use your plugin, run using the local `./bin/dev` or `./bin/dev.cmd` file.

```bash
# Run using local run file.
./bin/dev hello world
```

There should be no differences when running via the Salesforce CLI or using the local run file. However, it can be useful to link the plugin to do some additional testing or run your commands from anywhere on your machine.

```bash
# Link your plugin to the sf cli
sf plugins link .
# To verify
sf plugins
```
